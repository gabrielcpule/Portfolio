                      <ol>
                          <li>
                              <strong>Balance is critical</strong>: When transforming technical products for broader audiences, finding the right balance between power and simplicity is essential.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              <strong>Progressive disclosure</strong>: Designing interfaces that reveal complexity gradually allows both simple and advanced use cases to coexist.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              <strong>Cross-functional collaboration</strong>: Close partnership between design, product, and engineering teams was crucial for successful implementation of complex interaction patterns.
                          </li>
                          <li>

                          <h6>Discovery Phase</h6>
                          <ol>

                                  <strong>User Session Analysis</strong>
                                  <p>I began by analyzing user sessions during the onboarding process using Freshworks tools. I collected recordings of users who abandoned the process to identify drop-off points and friction areas. To build empathy, I arranged viewing sessions with our entire squad so everyone could directly observe user struggles.</p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  <strong>Quantitative Research</strong>
                                  <p>Based on initial findings, I designed and conducted surveys targeting users who had abandoned the onboarding process. The surveys focused on two key questions:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>Why did they abandon the process?</li>
                                      <li>Why didn't they return to complete it later?</li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p>I leveraged our database to reach out to users who had only completed the initial steps (providing email and name). With a 20% response rate, this provided valuable quantitative data about abandonment patterns.</p>
                              </li>
                              <li>
                                  <strong>In-Depth User Interviews</strong>
                                  <p>To incentivize participation, I offered interview participants entry into a raffle. This approach helped secure 15 in-depth interviews with users who had abandoned the onboarding process. These interviews explored:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>Detailed explanations of their survey responses</li>
                                      <li>Factors that would motivate them to complete the onboarding</li>
                                      <li>Competing platforms they were using instead</li>
                                  </ul>
                              </li>

                                  <strong>Key Insight</strong>
                                  <p>After synthesizing the research data, one critical insight emerged as the primary barrier:</p>
                                  <blockquote>The onboarding process took too long to complete, leading to high abandonment rates.</blockquote>
                                  <p>With this clear problem statement, we could focus our efforts on optimizing the length and complexity of the onboarding flow.</p>

                                  <p>After analyzing the full user journey, I identified that programming tests represented the most significant barrier for users. Since this was also an area where we could provide immediate value, I focused initial efforts there.</p>

                                  <strong>Gamification Implementation</strong>
                                  <p>I explored various gamification mechanics to increase test completion rates. The most successful approach was offering time-limited incentives: users who completed tests within 48 hours received subscription rewards from our partner companies. This provided motivation while costing us virtually nothing.</p>
                              </li>

                                  <p>To validate our approach, I implemented A/B testing for the gamification features. This ensured the improvements weren't just seasonal fluctuations and provided data-driven evidence for our design decisions.</p>

                                  <p>After improving test completion rates, I turned attention to the profile completion process. My approach included:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                      <li>Identifying and separating required fields from optional fields</li>
                                      <li>Restructuring the form to prioritize essential information</li>
                                      <li>Creating a dashboard that showed incomplete fields and explained how they would improve the candidate's visibility score</li>

                                  <strong>Information Architecture</strong>
                                  <p>I conducted card sorting exercises with colleagues to determine the optimal field order and page organization. This helped us create a more intuitive flow that reduced cognitive load.</p>

                      <h5>Key Learnings</h5>
                      <ol>
                          <li>
                              <strong>Team Involvement</strong>: Bringing everyone on the team to the same page creates a sense of ownership and motivates everyone to contribute their best work.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              <strong>Process Flexibility</strong>: While having a structured design process is essential, adapting methodologies to project needs is equally important. Not every step needs to be followed rigidly if it doesn't serve the specific project goals.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              <strong>Staged Improvements</strong>: Addressing the most critical barriers first allowed us to make significant improvements quickly before tackling more complex aspects of the experience.
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              <strong>Value of Direct Observation</strong>: Having team members directly observe user testing created more empathy and understanding than any report or presentation could achieve.
                          </li>
